# PreSens Manual


Protocol for set-up and take-down of the Oxy-10 and its probes, as well as how to use the PreSens Measurement Studio 2 to log and export data from the Oxy-10.  If you don't already have the PreSens program on your PC computer, download the software on the disk provided.


**Oxy-10 Set-Up**

Be very delicate with the oxygen probes.  Leave the cap on the end when not in use and do not scratch the tip.  The oxygen cord should never be coiled too tightly or bent, or the sensor will break.

1.	Insert each numbered Temp probe into the corresponding Temp port (lower ports) on the Oxy-10 by aligning the red dots and pushing gently until the dots meet.
1.	Remove the **black caps on the Oxy-10 Oxygen ports**, and the **red caps on the O2 probes** and place all caps in the bag labeled “Oxy-10 ST Caps”.
1.	Insert each numbered O2 probe into the corresponding O2 port (upper ports) on the Oxy-10 by aligning the metal pin on the port with the opening on the probe end.  Push in and turn the probe clockwise to catch the pin.
1.	Leave the black cap on the O2 probe until you’re ready to use the probe, then place these caps in the bag labeled “Oxygen Sensor Caps”.
1.	Attach the power supply to the lower port on the back of the Oxy-10 by inserting the connector and screwing until finger tight.
1.	Connect the domestic or appropriate international plug to the power supply and then plug into an electrical outlet.
1.	Plug the USB connector cord into your computer and the other end into the Oxy-10


**Creating and Assigning Measurement Files in PreSens**

Note: Before beginning your measurements, you must calculate the appropriate Oxygen Saturation Point for your samples collected.

1.	Open the PreSens program on your computer.
1. 	On the left sidebar, select "OXY-10 ST, O2" (The 10 available channels should show up in a drop down on the sidebar).
1.	In the Measurements tab, click "New" and type in a useful data file name for each measurement of each recording period.  If you are using all 10 sets of O2 and Temp, you will need to create and title 10 measurements per recording run.  Give unique, descriptive names to help manage and organize your data.
1.	Once all your new measurements are created, you need to assign them to each channel on the Oxy-10.  Click on the measurement title you created for Channel 1, select Channel 1 on the sidebar, then click “Assign to” to link the channel with your new measurement data file.  Do this for all 10 channels with your 10 unique measurement files.
1.	When you click each Channel on the sidebar, the "Measurement" description should now show your assigned data file name, and "Sensor" should show the appropriate corresponding O2 and Temp probes (Ex. Channel 1 should show "Sensor: OXY_CH1").   If any Channels do not have the correct probe number assigned, you must recalibrate the sensor using the provided detail sheet from the probe and by following the Probe Calibration steps, detailed below.


**Probe Calibration** (In progress)

1.  In the Sensors tab, select "New".
1.  Type in the name for your sensor (Ex. OXY_CH1) and select the probe type listed on your probe description sheet (Ex. PSt7_10)
1.	Select the appropriate OXY_CH# probe and Channel #, then click “Assign to” to link the coupled O2 and Temp probes to each Channel. 
1.  


**Running your program**

1. Each Channel must be directed to start recording individually.  In the Live View tab, select your first Channel on the sidebar and click “Start”.  Select each subsequent Channel and click "Start" until all Channels are recording data.  You can view the live O2 readings, current temperature, and pressure for each Channel by selecting the Channel and viewing the graph or recorded parameters to the right of the graph.
1.	Sensors will record every 1 second until you stop the program.
1.	To stop recording, click on the same first Channel you selected when starting, and in the Live View tab, click “Stop”.  Select each subsequent Channel and click "Stop" until all Channels have stopped recording.


**Exporting your data**

1.	In the Measurements tab, select all data files that were just used to record data by holding Ctrl and clicking each file, then click “Export”.
1.	For your first data file, select the file type as "CSV" or "Excel", then select a target location to store your exported file by clicking the “…” to the right of the Target field.  Click "Save".  Repeat for all subsequent files.
1.	Once all files have been assigned to a target storage location (all lights next ot the file names will change from red to green as the corresponding file has been assigned), click "Export".  Once the export has finished, click "OK".


**Shut-down, cleaning, and storage of Oxy-10**

1.	Close out of the program on your computer.  Detach the power and USB cables from the Oxy-10 and store cables in their labeled bags.
1.	Disconnect the Temp and O2 probes from the Oxy-10 ports and place the **black caps on the Oxy-10 O2 ports** and the **red caps on the O2 probe ends**.
1.	Fill two beakers with DI water (one for O2 probes and one for Temp probes) and submerge probe tips (any part of the probe exposed to your sample solution) for at least 15 minutes to rinse off any residue from your measurements.  Using a chemmwipe, gently wipe off water from all probes and place the black caps back on the O2 probe tips.
1.	After excessive use or after the last recording run of your experiment, follow up this DI rinse with a full probe and cord wipe-down using ethanol on a clean cloth or chemmwipe.
1.	Recoil the probes and store in their labeled bags.
